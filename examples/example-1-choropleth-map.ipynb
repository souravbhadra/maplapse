    "In this example, we will create an animation that shows how different counties in the Midwestern region of the United States have evolved in the overeall Corn Yield. The US Midwest is generally considered as the Corn Belt as most of the corn is produced in this region. The USDA also maintains a county level yield information for each year starting from as early as 1910. Therefore, the animated timelapse can be interesting in revealing the pattern of yield change over time."

Second, a `csv` file that has the temporal data to visualize. Another important information is to have a unique ID that can connect both the shapefile and the `csv` file."

You will find a shapefile named `county_shape.shp` (which is downlaoded from the TIGER Census dataset) and a csv file called `century_data.csv`. The csv file was downloaded from [USDA NASS Data and Statistics](https://www.nass.usda.gov/Data_and_Statistics/) website. You can choose from other agricultural statistics and rearrange the dataset accordingly. However, for this example the dataset is already processed in a nice csv file. Here, the unique ID to make a connection with the counties and the csv file is a combined field of State and County name. Here I concatenated the State and County name with a '_' in between them. However, you can do any way you want, but do this before workign with `MapLapse`."
